# Machine Learning Strategy: Satisficing and Optimizing Metrics

## 1. The Challenge: Combining Conflicting Goals
Sometimes it is difficult to combine all important metrics into a single mathematical formula (like "F1 Score").
* **Example:** You care about **Accuracy** (correctly identifying cats) AND **Running Time** (how fast the app responds).
* **The Problem:** Is a model with 95% accuracy and 1.5s runtime better than a model with 92% accuracy and 95ms runtime? It's hard to say using a simple average.

## 2. The Solution: Optimizing vs. Satisficing
Instead of trying to mash them into one number, split your metrics into two categories:

* **Optimizing Metric (Pick One):** This is the metric you want to improve as much as possible. You always prefer a higher value here.
    * *Example:* Accuracy.
* **Satisficing Metrics (Pick N-1):** These are constraints. You don't need them to be "perfect," you just need them to be **"good enough"** (pass a threshold).
    * *Example:* Running time must be $< 100\text{ms}$.


## 3. Real-World Examples

### A. Cat Classifier
| Classifier | Accuracy (Optimizing) | Running Time (Satisficing $< 100\text{ms}$) | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 90% | 80ms | Valid, but lower accuracy |
| **B** | **92%** | **95ms** | **Winner (Best Accuracy satisfying constraint)** |
| C | 95% | 1500ms | Rejected (Too slow) |

* **Goal:** Maximize Accuracy, subject to Running Time $\le 100\text{ms}$.
* **Result:** Classifier B is the best choice.

### B. Wake Word Detection ("Hey Siri" / "Alexa")
* **Optimizing Metric:** Maximize Accuracy (wake up whenever the user actually speaks).
* **Satisficing Metric:** False Positives $\le 1$ per 24 hours (don't wake up randomly more than once a day).
* **Strategy:** You don't need 0 false positives forever (impossible); you just need it to happen rarely enough that users don't get annoyed.
