# Machine Learning Strategy: Build Quickly, Then Iterate

## 1. The Challenge: Paralysis by Analysis
When starting a new ML project, there are often 50 different directions you could go.
* **Example (Speech Recognition):** Should you focus on noisy backgrounds (cafés)? Accents? Far-field microphones? Stuttering speakers?.
* **The Trap:** If you try to design a perfect system that handles all of these from day one, you will over-engineer it and waste time. It is difficult to know which of these problems is actually important without data.


## 2. The Solution: Build It Quick and Dirty
If you are tackling a new problem, do not overthink the first version.
**Guideline:** Build a quick, simple system immediately, then use it to learn what actually needs fixing.

## 3. The Three-Step Process
1.  **Set up Dev/Test Sets and Metric:** Decide where your "target" is (even if it's imperfect, just place it).
2.  **Build an Initial System Quickly:** Train a basic model. Do not worry about complex features yet.
3.  **Use Bias/Variance & Error Analysis:**
    * Now that you have a working (but likely poor) system, **measure** where it fails.
    * If Error Analysis shows most errors are due to "background noise," *then* you focus on that.
    * If Bias analysis shows you are underfitting, *then* you make the network bigger.


## 4. Exceptions
This advice applies strongly to **new** problems.
* **Exception:** If you have significant prior experience in the domain, or if there is a massive body of academic literature (e.g., Face Recognition), it is acceptable to start with a more complex, state-of-the-art approach because the "path" is already well-lit.
