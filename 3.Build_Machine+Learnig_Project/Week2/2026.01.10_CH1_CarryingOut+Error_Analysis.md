# Error Analysis: Prioritizing Your Efforts

## 1. The Scenario: "Is it worth fixing?"
Imagine your cat classifier has **90% accuracy** (10% error). A teammate notices the model is misclassifying **dogs** as cats and suggests a project to "fix the dog problem."
* **The Question:** Should you spend months building specific features to handle dogs?
* **The Risk:** You might spend 3 months fixing dogs only to realize they were rare exceptions, and your error rate barely moves.

## 2. The Solution: Manual Error Analysis
Instead of guessing, perform a quick manual check (takes 5-10 minutes).

1.  **Gather Data:** Collect ~100 **mislabeled** examples from your Dev Set.
2.  **Count:** Manually look at them and count how many are actually **dogs**.

### Interpreting the Results
* **Scenario A (Low Ceiling):**
    * Only **5 out of 100** errors are dogs (5%).
    * **Conclusion:** Even if you completely solve the dog problem, your error only drops from 10% to 9.5% (a 5% relative decrease). **Not worth the effort.**.
* **Scenario B (High Ceiling):**
    * **50 out of 100** errors are dogs (50%).
    * **Conclusion:** If you solve this, your error drops from 10% to 5%. **Highly worth the effort.**.



## 3. Evaluating Multiple Ideas in Parallel
You usually have several ideas at once (e.g., Fix dogs? Fix big cats like lions? Fix blurry images?). You can evaluate all of them simultaneously using a spreadsheet.

**The Process:**
1.  Create a table with columns for each "Idea" (Dog, Great Cat, Blurry, etc.).
2.  Go through 100 misclassified images.
3.  Check the box for every category that applies to that image.
4.  Sum up the percentages to see the "Ceiling" (potential improvement) for each idea.

**Example Analysis Table:**

| Image ID | Dog | Great Cat (Lion/Panther) | Blurry | Comments |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | ✓ | | | Pitbull |
| 2 | | | ✓ | Rain on lens |
| 3 | | ✓ | ✓ | Zoo lion |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| **% of Total** | **8%** | **43%** | **61%** | |

**Decision:**
* **Blurry images (61%)** and **Great Cats (43%)** are the biggest problems.
* Focusing on **Dogs (8%)** would be a waste of resources compared to the others.
* *Note:* You can add new columns (like "Instagram Filters") on the fly if you notice a pattern while looking at the data.
