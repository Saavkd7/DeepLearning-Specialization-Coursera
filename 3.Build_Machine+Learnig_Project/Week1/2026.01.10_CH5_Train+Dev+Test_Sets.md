# Machine Learning Strategy: Dev and Test Sets

## 1. The Golden Rule
**Choose a Dev set and Test set to come from the SAME distribution.**
This is the single most important rule for organizing your data.
* **Analogy:** Think of the Dev set as the target (Bullseye). Your team spends months shooting arrows (training models) to hit this target. If you then test them on a *different* target (Test set), all that practice was wasted. You want to aim at the same target you will be tested on.


## 2. Common Pitfalls (How to Fail)

### A. The Region Split (Cat Classifier Example)
* **Mistake:** You put US, UK, Europe, and South America data in the **Dev Set**. You put India, China, Asia, and Australia data in the **Test Set**.
* **Result:** The data distributions are completely different. A cat in a UK garden looks different from a cat in a crowded Asian market. Your model optimizes for "Western Cats" and then fails on "Eastern Cats".

### B. The Income Split (Loan Approval Example)
* **True Story:** A team spent 3 months optimizing a loan approval model on **Medium Income** zip codes (Dev Set). Then, the manager tested it on **Low Income** zip codes (Test Set).
* **Result:** The model failed miserably because the patterns of repayment are different. The team wasted 3 months aiming at the wrong target.


## 3. The Correct Approach
1.  **Shuffle Everything:** Take all your data (US, UK, China, India, etc.) and randomly shuffle it *before* splitting.
2.  **Split:**
    * Randomly assign a chunk to **Dev**.
    * Randomly assign a chunk to **Test**.
3.  **Result:** Both sets contain a mix of all regions/types. They reflect the same distribution.

## 4. Guideline
**"Choose a dev set and test set to reflect data you expect to get in the future and consider important to do well on."**.
