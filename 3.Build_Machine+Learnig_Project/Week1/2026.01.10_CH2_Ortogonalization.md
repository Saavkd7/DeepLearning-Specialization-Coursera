# Machine Learning Strategy: Orthogonalization

## 1. Executive Summary
**Orthogonalization** is a strategy to ensure that the adjustments you make to your machine learning system have clear, isolated effects.
* **The Goal:** You want to be able to tune one aspect of your system (like training accuracy) without messing up another aspect (like test set generalization).
* **Why it matters:** If a single "knob" (hyperparameter or architectural change) affects multiple distinct performance metrics simultaneously, it becomes nearly impossible to tune the system to perfection.

## 2. The Analogies

### The Old School TV
Imagine an old TV with knobs to adjust the picture.
* **Orthogonal Controls:** One knob adjusts **Height**, another adjusts **Width**, another adjusts **Rotation**. This makes it easy to center the picture.
* **Non-Orthogonal Controls:** Imagine a knob that adjusts $0.1 \times \text{Height} + 0.3 \times \text{Width} - 1.7 \times \text{Rotation}$. If you turn this knob, everything changes at once. You fix the height, but now the width is wrong. It is impossible to tune.


### The Car
Driving a car requires controlling **Steering** (Angle) and **Speed** (Acceleration/Braking).
* **Orthogonal:** The steering wheel only controls direction. The pedals only control speed.
* **Non-Orthogonal:** Imagine a joystick where moving it right changes the steering angle **AND** speeds up the car. It would be incredibly difficult to drive accurately.

## 3. Orthogonalization in Machine Learning
In ML, we have four distinct goals (or assumptions) that we try to satisfy in a specific order. To be effective, we need "knobs" that address each goal individually without breaking the others.

The four goals are:
1.  **Fit Training Set Well:** (e.g., comparable to human-level performance).
2.  **Fit Dev (Development) Set Well:** (Generalization).
3.  **Fit Test Set Well:** (Performance on data never seen before).
4.  **Perform Well in the Real World:** (The cost function actually matches user satisfaction).
