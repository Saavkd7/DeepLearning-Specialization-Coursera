# Introduction to Machine Learning Strategy

## 1. The Challenge: So Many Options
When your machine learning system isn't performing well enough (e.g., your cat classifier has 90% accuracy but you need more), you are faced with a huge list of possible fixes.
* Collect more data?
* Train longer?
* Use a bigger network?
* Use Dropout or L2 Regularization?
* Change the architecture?

## 2. The Risk: Wasted Time
If you choose the wrong path, you can lose massive amounts of time.
* **Example:** A team might spend **6 months** collecting more data, only to realize later that data quantity wasn't the problem, and the model's performance barely budged.
* **Goal:** Machine Learning Strategy provides a framework to analyze your problem *first*, so you know ahead of time which approaches are worth pursuing and which to discard.
