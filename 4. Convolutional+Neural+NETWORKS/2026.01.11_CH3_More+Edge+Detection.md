# More Edge Detection: Positive/Negative Edges & Learning Filters

## 1. Positive vs. Negative Edges
The convolution operation doesn't just find an edge; it tells you the **direction** of the transition (Light $\to$ Dark vs. Dark $\to$ Light).

* **Positive Edge (Light $\to$ Dark):** If you transition from bright pixels (10) to dark pixels (0), the convolution output is positive (e.g., $+30$).
* **Negative Edge (Dark $\to$ Light):** If you transition from dark pixels (0) to bright pixels (10), the convolution output is negative (e.g., $-30$).
* *Note:* If you don't care about the direction, you can simply take the absolute value of the output matrix.


## 2. Horizontal Edge Detection
To detect horizontal lines (like a horizon or a railing), you simply rotate the vertical filter by 90 degrees.

**The Horizontal Filter:**
```math
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & -1 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
```
* This looks for differences between the **top row** and the **bottom row**.


## 3. Hand-Coded Filter Variations
Before Deep Learning, computer vision researchers debated the "best" numbers to put in these filters to make them robust. Two famous examples are:

* **Sobel Filter:** Put more weight on the central row (1, 2, 1) to make it more robust.
```math
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 0 & -1 \\
    2 & 0 & -2 \\
    1 & 0 & -1
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
```
* **Scharr Filter:** Uses even stronger weights (3, 10, 3).
```math
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3 & 0 & -3 \\
    10 & 0 & -10 \\
    3 & 0 & -3
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$

```
## 4. The Deep Learning Approach: Learning the Filter
Instead of hand-picking these numbers (1, 0, -1 vs. 3, 10, -3), we can let the neural network **learn** them.

* **The Idea:** Treat the 9 numbers in the $3 \times 3$ filter as **parameters** ($w_1, w_2, \dots, w_9$) just like weights in a standard neural network.
* **The Process:** Use **Backpropagation** to learn the optimal values for these 9 numbers based on the data.
* **The Benefit:** The network isn't limited to just vertical or horizontal edges. It can learn to detect edges at **45 degrees**, **70 degrees**, or any specific feature that helps minimize the loss function. This is significantly more robust than human-coded filters.
