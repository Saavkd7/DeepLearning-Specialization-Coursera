# Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## 1. Introduction to Computer Vision
Computer Vision is one of the most rapidly advancing fields in Deep Learning. It enables machines to "see" and interpret the world, powering technologies like:
* **Self-Driving Cars:** Detecting pedestrians and other vehicles to avoid collisions.
* **Face Recognition:** Unlocking phones or doors using facial identity.
* **App Filters:** Creating art or enhancing photos on mobile apps.

## 2. Key Computer Vision Problems
In this course, we will focus on solving three major types of problems:

### A. Image Classification
* **Goal:** Input an image and output a label (e.g., "Cat" or "Not Cat").
* **Example:** Taking a $64 \times 64$ pixel image and recognizing the subject.


### B. Object Detection
* **Goal:** Not just recognizing *what* is in the image, but *where* it is.
* **Mechanism:** The model must draw bounding boxes around multiple objects (e.g., detecting other cars on the road for a self-driving system).


### C. Neural Style Transfer
* **Goal:** Repaint a content image in the artistic style of another image.
* **Example:** Taking a photo of a university and "repainting" it in the style of a Picasso painting.


## 3. The Challenge: Large Inputs
Standard fully connected neural networks (from Course 1 & 2) fail when applied to high-resolution images due to the massive number of parameters required.

### The Math of the Problem
* **Small Image ($64 \times 64$):**
    * Input dimension: $64 \times 64 \times 3 \text{ (RGB)} = 12,288$.
    * This is manageable for standard networks.
* **Large Image ($1000 \times 1000$):**
    * Input dimension: $1000 \times 1000 \times 3 = 3,000,000$ features ($3$ million).
* **The Parameter Explosion:**
    * If you connect these $3$ million inputs to a hidden layer with just $1,000$ units:
    * Weight Matrix ($W^{[1]}$) size: $(1000, 3,000,000)$.
    * Total Parameters: **3 Billion**.

### Consequences
1.  **Overfitting:** With billions of parameters, it is nearly impossible to get enough data to prevent overfitting.
2.  **Computational Cost:** Training a model of this size is computationally infeasible for most hardware.

## 4. The Solution: Convolution
To handle large images effectively, we need a better operation than standard matrix multiplication. This operation is called **Convolution**. It is the fundamental building block of CNNs and allows us to detect features (like edges) without exploding the parameter count.
