nexting the prompt 

Understood. I have locked in this structure for all future responses. Here is the template I will use for every new concept you provide:

Markdown Conceptual Guide:

Definitions, Formulas, and Technical Notes.

Relation to Earlier Concepts: A dedicated subsection explaining how this new piece fits with previous topics (like edge detection, standard neural networks, etc.).

Basic Chunk Implementation: A small, copy-pasteable Python snippet focusing only on the core logic (using numpy).

Full Visualization Implementation:

A separate, self-contained code block using matplotlib to visualize the input, operation, and output.
