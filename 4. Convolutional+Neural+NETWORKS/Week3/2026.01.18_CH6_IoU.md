# Intersection Over Union (IoU)

## 1. What is IoU?
In object detection, your model outputs a predicted bounding box. But how do you know if it's "correct"? It rarely matches the ground truth box pixel-for-pixel.
**IoU** is a function that measures the overlap between two bounding boxes:
1.  The **Ground Truth** box (the actual object).
2.  The **Predicted** box (what your network thinks).

## 2. The Formula
$$IoU = \frac{\text{Size of Intersection}}{\text{Size of Union}}$$

* **Intersection:** The area where the two boxes overlap (the orange region).
* **Union:** The total area covered by both boxes combined (the green region).


## 3. Evaluating Correctness
* **Perfect Match:** $IoU = 1$.
* **Convention:** A detection is usually considered "correct" if **$IoU \ge 0.5$**.
* **Stringency:** If you need higher precision, you can set the threshold higher (e.g., 0.6 or 0.7). It is rarely set below 0.5.

## 4. Relation to Earlier Concepts
* **Bounding Box Prediction:** In the YOLO and Localization sections, we trained networks to output $b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w$. IoU is the tool we use during **evaluation** to score those outputs.
* **Non-Max Suppression (Next):** IoU is not just for evaluation; it is a critical component of the Non-Max Suppression algorithm (coming next) used to filter out duplicate detections of the same object.

## 5. Basic Chunk Implementation (IoU Logic)
This function calculates IoU given two boxes defined by their corners `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

```python
def calculate_iou(box1, box2):
    """
    box: [x1, y1, x2, y2] (Top-left, Bottom-right coordinates)
    """
    # 1. Calculate Intersection Coordinates
    xi1 = max(box1[0], box2[0])
    yi1 = max(box1[1], box2[1])
    xi2 = min(box1[2], box2[2])
    yi2 = min(box1[3], box2[3])
    
    # 2. Calculate Intersection Area
    inter_width = max(0, xi2 - xi1)
    inter_height = max(0, yi2 - yi1)
    inter_area = inter_width * inter_height
    
    # 3. Calculate Union Area
    box1_area = (box1[2] - box1[0]) * (box1[3] - box1[1])
    box2_area = (box2[2] - box2[0]) * (box2[3] - box2[1])
    union_area = box1_area + box2_area - inter_area
    
    # 4. IoU
    return inter_area / union_area
