# Deep Learning Frameworks

## 1. Executive Summary
While learning algorithms from scratch (using Python and NumPy) is critical for understanding the mechanics, it is generally impractical for building complex applications.
* **The Problem:** Implementing advanced models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) from scratch is inefficient and prone to errors.
* **The Solution:** Use Deep Learning Frameworks.
* **The Analogy:** Just as you understand how **matrix multiplication** works but rely on optimized linear algebra libraries to actually do it in production, you should understand the math of deep learning but rely on frameworks to implement it efficiently.

## 2. Leading Frameworks
There are many competitive frameworks available today. The landscape changes rapidly, so rather than endorsing one, it is better to understand how to choose one.
*(Common examples include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.)*.



## 3. Criteria for Choosing a Framework
When selecting a framework, focus on these three key factors:

### A. Ease of Programming
* Does it allow you to develop and iterate quickly?
* Does it support easy deployment for production (serving millions of users)?

### B. Running Speed
* How efficiently can it train large neural networks on massive datasets?
* Performance varies between frameworks depending on the specific task.

### C. Truly Open (Governance)
* **Open Source vs. Open Governance:** Being "open source" is not enough.
* **The Risk:** Some frameworks are controlled by a single corporation. There is a risk that the company might gradually close off features or move functionality to their proprietary cloud services.
* **Recommendation:** Look for frameworks with good governance that you trust to remain truly open long-term.
