# Hyperparameter Tuning: Strategies for Success

## 1. The Hierarchy of Importance
You cannot tune everything at once. Some hyperparameters matter much more than others.

* **Tier 1 (Most Critical):**
    * **Learning Rate ($\alpha$):** This is the single most important knob to turn. If this is wrong, nothing else matters.
* **Tier 2 (Important):**
    * **Momentum ($\beta$):** Usually 0.9.
    * **Mini-Batch Size:** e.g., 64, 128.
    * **Hidden Units:** The number of neurons in hidden layers.
* **Tier 3 (Secondary):**
    * **Number of Layers:** Depth of the network.
    * **Learning Rate Decay:** How fast $\alpha$ shrinks.
* **Tier 4 (Do Not Touch):**
    * **Adam Parameters ($\beta_1, \beta_2, \epsilon$):** Just use the defaults ($0.9, 0.999, 10^{-8}$).

## 2. Search Strategy: Random vs. Grid
How do you explore the search space?

### The Old Way: Grid Search
* **Method:** You pick specific values at regular intervals (e.g., a $5 \times 5$ grid).
* **The Flaw:** If one hyperparameter (like $\epsilon$) doesn't matter for the result, you are wasting massive amounts of compute. In a $5 \times 5$ grid, you effectively only test **5 values** of the important parameter (like $\alpha$).

### The Better Way: Random Search
* **Method:** You pick points randomly within the defined range.
* **The Advantage:** In the same 25 trials, you test **25 distinct values** of the important parameter ($\alpha$). This drastically increases your chances of finding the "sweet spot".

## 3. Refining the Search: Coarse to Fine
Once you find a region that looks promising using random sampling, do not stop there.

1.  **Coarse Search:** Search the entire massive space randomly.
2.  **Analyze:** You notice that the best results are clustered in a specific corner (e.g., $\alpha$ between 0.1 and 0.2).
3.  **Fine Search:** Zoom into that small "Blue Square" and sample densely within that region to find the precise optimal value.
