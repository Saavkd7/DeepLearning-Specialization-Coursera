Regularization is a powerful tool to prevent **overfitting**, but it isn't always necessary. Here is the short answer on when to skip it:

---

### 1. Large Datasets
If you have a massive amount of data relative to the number of features, the model is less likely to "memorize" noise. The sheer volume of information acts as a natural stabilizer, making manual regularization redundant.

### 2. Underfitting Models
If your model is already too simple and performs poorly on both training and validation sets (**high bias**), adding regularization will only make it worse. Regularization constrains the model further, which is the opposite of what an underperforming model needs.



### 3. Low Feature-to-Observation Ratio
When you have a very small number of features (e.g., 2 or 3) and thousands of observations, the risk of overfitting is minimal. In these cases, the "standard" least squares or maximum likelihood estimates are usually sufficient.

### 4. Noisy Data is Not an Issue
If your data is "perfect" (simulated data or physical laws with zero noise), you want the model to fit the data exactly. Regularization intentionally introduces a small amount of bias to handle noise; if there is no noise, that bias is purely detrimental.

### Summary Table

| Scenario | Use Regularization? | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Variance** (Overfitting) | **Yes** | Reduces complexity to generalize better. |
| **High Bias** (Underfitting) | **No** | It will increase bias and decrease accuracy. |
| **Huge Dataset** | **Usually No** | The data volume prevents overfitting naturally. |
| **Few Features** | **No** | Minimal risk of the model getting "lost" in noise. |
