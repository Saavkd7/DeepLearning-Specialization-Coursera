# Exponentially Weighted Averages: Bias Correction

## 1. The Problem: The "Cold Start"
When you initialize your moving average, you start with $V_0 = 0$.
This creates a mathematical error in the early steps.
* **Day 1:** $V_1 = 0.98(0) + 0.02(40^{\circ}) = 0.8^{\circ}$.
* **The Reality:** The temperature was $40^{\circ}$, but your average says $0.8^{\circ}$.
* **The Result:** The average starts effectively at zero and takes a long time to "warm up" to the correct range. In the chart, this is the **Purple Curve**, which lags significantly below the true data (Green Curve) at the start.

## 2. The Solution: Bias Correction Formula
To fix this, you do not use $V_t$ directly. Instead, you divide it by a correction factor that changes over time.

$$\text{Corrected } V_t = \frac{V_t}{1 - \beta^t}$$

* $t$: The current time step (day 1, day 2, etc.).
* $\beta$: Your hyperparameter (e.g., 0.98).

## 3. Why It Works
This formula naturally scales up the early values while leaving later values alone.

### Phase A: Early Steps (e.g., $t=2, \beta=0.98$)
* Factor: $1 - (0.98)^2 = 1 - 0.9604 = 0.0396$.
* Action: You divide your tiny calculated value ($V_t$) by this tiny number ($0.0396$). This acts like a multiplier, boosting the estimate up to the correct range.
* **Result:** The Purple Curve jumps up to become the Green Curve.

### Phase B: Late Steps (e.g., $t=1000$)
* Factor: $1 - (0.98)^{1000} \approx 1 - 0 = 1$.
* Action: You divide $V_t$ by 1. The correction effectively disappears.
* **Result:** Once the average has "warmed up," the correction turns itself off automatically.

## 4. Practical Note
In Deep Learning, many people **skip bias correction**.
* **Why?** We typically care about the model's performance after thousands of steps. The initial "warm-up" phase is negligible in the grand scheme of training. However, if early tracking accuracy is critical, you must use this correction.
